Static analysis for OCaml cryptographic code

OCaml Crypto Linter is a comprehensive security tool that detects
cryptographic vulnerabilities in OCaml codebases. It performs deep
AST analysis with interprocedural dataflow tracking to identify:

- Weak cryptographic algorithms (DES, MD5, SHA1)
- Hardcoded keys and secrets
- Timing attack vulnerabilities
- API misuse patterns
- Outdated crypto library dependencies

The tool integrates seamlessly with OCaml build systems and CI/CD
pipelines, providing multiple output formats including JSON and SARIF
for security dashboards.
