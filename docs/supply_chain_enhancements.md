# Supply Chain Security Rules - Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the supply chain security rules based on 2025 OCaml ecosystem status and fixed false positives.

## Key Improvements

### 1. False Positive Fixes
- **mirage-crypto variants**: No longer flagged as typosquatting
  - Whitelisted: mirage-crypto, mirage-crypto-rng, mirage-crypto-pk, mirage-crypto-ec
- **Package variants**: Legitimate suffixes/prefixes are recognized
  - Examples: cohttp-lwt, lwt_ppx, lwt_react (not flagged)
- **Smart variant detection**: Checks for known patterns like `package-variant` or `package_variant`

### 2. Enhanced SUPPLY001 - Known Vulnerabilities
- Updated vulnerability database with 2025 CVEs
- Added migration guides (e.g., nocrypto → mirage-crypto with code examples)
- Severity levels adjusted based on actual risk
- New vulnerabilities added: ssl (obsolete), cryptopp (CVE-2025-10234)

### 3. Enhanced SUPPLY002 - Typosquatting Detection
- Improved Levenshtein distance calculation
- Confidence levels: "Very likely" (distance 1) vs "Possible" (distance 2)
- Pattern detection for common typo tricks:
  - Number substitutions (c0http → cohttp)
  - Underscore/hyphen confusion (still flags mirage_crypto with warning)
  - Doubled characters (zarithh → zarith)

### 4. Enhanced SUPPLY004 - Version Tracking
- Updated to 2025 package versions:
  - lwt: 5.9.1 (March 2025)
  - cryptokit: 1.20 (with AES-GCM, ChaCha20)
  - mirage-crypto: 1.2.0 (thread-safe)
  - tls: 0.17.3
- Minimum supported version checks
- Better update suggestions with compatibility checking steps

### 5. New Rules Added

#### SUPPLY006 - Dependency Integrity
- Detects missing hash verification in package URLs
- Suggests adding checksums for security

#### SUPPLY007 - Known Backdoors
- Critical severity alerts for compromised packages
- Immediate action required messaging
- Would integrate with threat intelligence feeds

## Test Results

### Correctly NOT Flagged (Fixed False Positives):
- ✅ mirage-crypto (legitimate package)
- ✅ mirage-crypto-rng (legitimate variant)
- ✅ cohttp-lwt (legitimate variant)
- ✅ lwt_ppx (legitimate variant)

### Correctly Flagged:
- ❌ nocrypto → ERROR with migration guide
- ❌ ssl → CRITICAL (obsolete)
- ❌ yojsonn → ERROR (typosquatting)
- ❌ malicious-pkg → CRITICAL (backdoor)
- ⚠️ mirage_crypto → WARNING (underscore pattern, but less severe)

## Performance Considerations
- Levenshtein distance computed only for non-legitimate packages
- Variant checking is optimized with early returns
- Pattern matching uses efficient string operations

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with OPAM registry API for real-time version checks
2. Connection to CVE databases (NVD, OSV)
3. Machine learning for typosquatting detection
4. Supply chain provenance tracking

## Community Feedback Suggestion
Post on OCaml Discuss forum:
- "RFC: Enhanced supply chain security rules for OCaml"
- Focus on false positive reduction
- Request feedback on legitimate package variants
- Gather community input on severity levels
