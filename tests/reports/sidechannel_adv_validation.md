# Advanced Side-Channel Rules Validation Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented 5 advanced side-channel detection rules based on latest CPU vulnerabilities including AMD TSA (CVE-2025-36350) and Spectre variants. The rules use abstract interpretation for comprehensive constant-time verification.

## Rules Implemented

### CPU-Level Side Channels
- **SIDEA001**: Speculative Execution Vulnerability Pattern (Critical)
  - Detects Spectre v1 bounds check bypass
  - Identifies indirect branch targets (Spectre v2)
  
- **SIDEA002**: AMD Transient Scheduler Attack Pattern (Error)
  - Detects tight loops vulnerable to TSA
  - Flags store queue pressure patterns

### Memory Side Channels  
- **SIDEA003**: Store Queue Side-Channel Leakage (Error)
  - Store-to-load forwarding vulnerabilities
  - 4K aliasing detection

### Execution Side Channels
- **SIDEA004**: Execution Port Contention Side-Channel (Warning)
  - Port-heavy operations on secrets
  - Single-threaded contention patterns

### Verification
- **SIDEA005**: Non-Constant-Time Operation Detection (Error)
  - Abstract interpretation for secret tracking
  - Comprehensive variable-time operation detection

## Test Results

### Detection Summary
- **19 total findings** in test file
- 1 Critical (Spectre v1)
- 14 Errors (TSA, constant-time violations)
- 4 Warnings (timing attacks, port contention)

### Key Detections

1. **Spectre v1 Pattern** (Line 12)
   - Classic bounds check bypass vulnerability
   - Suggests index masking and speculation barriers

2. **AMD TSA Vulnerabilities** (Lines 55, 65)
   - Tight loops with memory operations
   - Recommends memory barriers and microcode updates

3. **Variable-Time Operations** (Multiple)
   - Division and modulo on secrets
   - Non-constant comparisons
   - Secret-dependent branches

## Implementation Highlights

### Abstract Interpretation Framework
```ocaml
module Abstract_Domain = struct
  type secret_level = 
    | Public
    | Secret of string
    | Tainted of string * string
```

### Advanced Pattern Detection
- Speculative execution gadget identification
- Port contention analysis
- Store queue interaction tracking
- Constant-time verification via dataflow

## Mitigations Provided

1. **Spectre v1**: Index masking, speculation barriers, branchless checks
2. **AMD TSA**: Memory barriers, avoiding tight loops, microcode updates
3. **Port Contention**: Constant-time alternatives, masking, dummy operations
4. **Store Queue**: Memory barriers, separate regions, avoiding aliasing
5. **Constant-Time**: Branchless algorithms, constant-time libraries (Eqaf)

## Next Steps

- Implement supply chain security rules
- Add ZKP vulnerability detection
- Create HSM integration checks
- Enhance abstract interpretation for interprocedural analysis
